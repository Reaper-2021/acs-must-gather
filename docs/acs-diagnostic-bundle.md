# RHACS Diagnostic Bundle (`acs-diagnostic-bundle`)

The image collects two complementary layers of data:

- **acs-must-gather** collects platform-specific data about the OpenShift cluster where RHACS is running (operator, workloads, cluster-scoped resources, RBAC, logs).
- **acs-diagnostic-bundle** collects deep RHACS-related data — the full diagnostic bundle produced by `roxctl central debug download-diagnostics` — from Central and every connected Secured Cluster.

## What is collected

Extracted into the `acs-diagnostic-bundle/` folder. This is the full diagnostic
bundle produced by `roxctl central debug download-diagnostics`, downloaded from
Central's `/api/extensions/diagnostics` endpoint and unpacked so it is browsable
within the must-gather. It contains deep RHACS data from Central and every
connected Secured Cluster, including:

- Build versions and Central-DB (PostgreSQL) diagnostics (`pg_stat` statistics)
- Prometheus metrics and heap / goroutine / mutex profiles
- System configuration, scrubbed auth providers, roles, and notifiers
- Telemetry data
- Kubernetes introspection (resource manifests, pod logs, events) from Central and each Secured Cluster

Central serves this endpoint with admin authentication only. The password is read
from the `central-htpasswd` secret (falling back to `stackrox-admin-password`), and
Central is reached over an `oc port-forward` since Central container images do not
ship `curl`.
